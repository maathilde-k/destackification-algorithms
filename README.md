# Resolution of singularities of toric stacks
This repository contains the code to perform the destackification algorithms on toric stacks described in "Functorial Destackification of Tame Stacks with Abelian Stabilizers" by Daniel Bergh (2014).

These algorithms rely on the equivalence of categories between toric stacks and stacky fans described in "The Category of Toric Stacks" by Isamu Iwanari (2009). 

For a introductory treatment of a simpler result, please consult the notes by by Ameer Muhiladeen, Mathilde Kermorgant and Yifan Guo on the correspondance between normal toric varieties and cones found in sss.pdf. Note that these notes were created in the context of a final presentation for a graduate-level commutative algebra class. As such, a course on commutative algebra or algebraic varieties is a pre-requisite to understanding the notes.
